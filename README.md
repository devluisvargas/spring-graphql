# Spring GraphQL Application

## Project Description
This "Spring GraphQL" application is a practice project designed to explore the implementation of GraphQL technology in a Spring Boot environment. The project serves as a hands-on example to understand how GraphQL can be integrated with Spring Boot for building efficient, flexible APIs.

## Key Features
- **GraphQL Integration**: Utilizes GraphQL for building a flexible and efficient API layer.
- **Spring Boot Framework**: Leverages Spring Boot for rapid development and ease of application setup.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Implements JPA for robust database operations and object-relational mapping.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Uses PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database.
- **Lombok**: Simplifies the code by reducing boilerplate, such as getters, setters, and constructors.
- **Docker Support**: Includes Dockerfile and Docker Compose for easy deployment and setup of a PostgreSQL database in a development environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: For creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **GraphQL**: For building the API layer.
- **JPA**: For database interaction and object-relational mapping.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the relational database system.
- **Lombok**: For reducing Java boilerplate code.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and database.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/devluisvargas/spring-graphql.git`
2. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and run `mvn clean install`.
3. **Run with Docker**: Use `docker-compose up` to start the PostgreSQL database.
4. **Start the Application**: Run the Spring Boot application.
